# MATH36032-Project-Three
Code and report for third MATH36032 coursework 

This was a project on data science. We were given a dataset of the price of bananas from dozens of countries and we had to analyse and represent the data graphically. 

There are four m-files, one for each of the four questions, and a report in pdf format which discussed the problems and my solutions to them.
